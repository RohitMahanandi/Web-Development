The legislation would provide $36.5 billion in emergency relief as Puerto Rico in particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this month. The Trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from Congress. \",\n          \"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party.  What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,  Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd. A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that. On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.  This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday. For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis. Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan. Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory. On Monday, Chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  One China  policy and  constitute an interference in China s internal affairs .   China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,  Lu told a daily news briefing. China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added.  Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China s military deployments as irresponsible. Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. Taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , Huang said. Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  Huang was quoted as saying. Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year. China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China. The United States is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 716,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"September 2, 2017 \",\n          \"February 2, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

He met with representatives from the coal industry to sign a bill undoing Obama s coal mining rule. The people s president is a worker!OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON SCOTT PRUITT S APPOINTMENT TO EPA CHIEF THE LEFT WENT BONKERS!OKLAHOMA ATTORNEY GENERAL SCOTT PRUITT is another perfect choice from President-elect Donald Trump. He s sued the feds several times for their overreach in regulations on the coal industry. You have to love his commitment to keeping the federal government on the straight and narrow. It s funny that so many of Trump s picks have gone against Obama s policies We love it! The lefty politicians in DC wasted no time tweeted out their displeasure:When the Environmental Protection Agency proposed rules regulating carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, Scott Pruitt sued. When the Justice Department offered legal status to young undocumented immigrants, Scott Pruitt sued. And when the Obama administration sought to give tax credits to states that hadn t set up their own health insurance exchanges, Scott Pruitt sued.Since becoming Oklahoma attorney general in 2010, Pruitt has filed or joined lawsuits against federal agencies at least a dozen times. Even when Oklahoma isn t an actual party in litigation, the state often submits a legal brief against the federal government. Besides air pollution, immigration and health care, Pruitt has fought federal laws and regulations on banking, contraception and endangered species. These days, whenever states go to court against the Obama administration, the chances are that Pruitt is somehow involved.Not that Pruitt is alone. During Obama s presidency, the entire cadre of Republican attorneys general (27 at present) has coordinated cases against federal agencies at an unprecedented pace. But Pruitt is at the center of the action. He has set up a first-in-the-nation  federalism unit,  which seeks to combat instances of federal overreach by every possible means.Read more: Governing\",\n          \" (In this Oct. 13 story, corrects description of legal standard regarding Trump in paragraph 15) By Alison Frankel and Dan Levine (Reuters) - Donald Trump hasn\\u2019t sued a newspaper for libel in three decades, despite the Republican presidential nominee repeatedly threatening to do so over the course of his business career, according to databases of state and federal court records.  A lawyer for the New York real estate developer demanded on Wednesday The New York Times retract a story in which two women accused Trump of inappropriately touching them. If the newspaper did not comply, Trump, who says the allegations are fabricated, would \\u201cpursue all available actions and remedies,\\u201d the lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said in a letter.  Trump said at a rally on Thursday he was preparing a lawsuit.  An attorney for the Times, David McCraw, said the story was of national importance and the paper would \\u201cwelcome the opportunity\\u201d to defend it in court. Over the years, media outlets including the Wall Street Journal, the Village Voice, the New York Post and Fortune Magazine have reported receiving similar threats from Trump or his representatives in advance of unflattering articles. However, Trump rarely makes good on those threats, according to a Reuters review of court dockets in the database of online legal research service Westlaw, a unit of Thomson Reuters.   \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 The last time he sued a news organization for libel was apparently in 1984. Trump filed the case after the Chicago Tribune\\u2019s architecture critic called his proposed 150-story Manhattan skyscraper an \\u201catrocious, ugly monstrosity.\\u201d In 1985, a federal judge in Manhattan dismissed the suit, ruling the critic had a First Amendment right to express his opinion. The skyscraper was never built. In the 32 years since Trump brought that suit, he has not taken similar action against another news organization, although he or his companies have sued at least three individuals and a book publisher. He was successful in one of those cases.  Book author and former New York Times reporter Timothy O\\u2019Brien defeated a Trump libel lawsuit in 2011, after Trump underwent a grueling deposition by O\\u2019Brien\\u2019s lawyers.  Trump\\u2019s suit against O\\u2019Brien, which also named O\\u2019Brien\\u2019s publisher, Time Warner Book Group, alleged the author deliberately underestimated the businessman\\u2019s net worth. A New Jersey state judge found in 2009 that Trump had not established O\\u2019Brien\\u2019s actual malice. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Former Miss Universe contestant Sheena Monnin was hit with a $5 million default judgment after she failed to appear for arbitration in a case in which Trump claimed she falsely denigrated the pageant as \\u201crigged.\\u201d The arbitration judgment was upheld by a federal judge in Manhattan in 2013. The court record indicates the judgment was paid in 2014. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 The same year, a San Diego federal judge ruled Tarla Makaeff, who was lead plaintiff in a class action against Trump University, did not act with malice when she said in letters to her bank and the Better Business Bureau that Trump University engaged in fraudulent business practices. The judge, Gonzalo Curiel, dismissed Trump\\u2019s defamation claim. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Trump\\u2019s attorneys, as well as a spokeswoman for his campaign, did not respond to requests for comment on his libel litigation record, including requests for information on any suits the Reuters docket search may have missed. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0U.S. courts have routinely deemed Trump a public figure in libel lawsuits. That means he has to show not only that the story is false, but also that the media outlet knew that it was false or published it in \\u201creckless disregard\\u201d for the truth. If Trump were a private person, he would have to show the paper was negligent in failing to learn the allegations were false, which is a lower standard of proof. The New York Times attorney, David McCraw, wrote that the paper carefully vetted the allegations in the story. Any Trump claim will be difficult because Trump\\u2019s accusers were on the record, said Jane Kirtley, a media law expert at University of Minnesota Law School. That would bolster the newspaper\\u2019s argument that it didn\\u2019t act recklessly in publishing their accounts. Trump has vowed to \\u201copen up our libel laws,\\u201d if he wins the presidency on Nov. 8, to make it easier to sue news organizations. In reality, he would not be able to unilaterally change the laws because they are generally governed by individual states and court precedents. Court records show that Trump or his businesses have themselves been sued several times for libel or defamation. Most of those suits, including a complaint by a former tenant of a Trump condominium and another by a former dealer at a Trump casino in Indiana, were dismissed. One defamation suit against Trump survived dismissal, however. Stock analyst Marvin Roffman sued Trump for $2 million in federal court in Philadelphia in 1990, claiming he was fired from his job after publicly predicting the failure of the Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City. Roffman alleged Trump defamed him in critical statements to numerous newspapers and magazines. After a federal judge refused to toss the case, the Trump Organization settled in 1991. An attorney for Roffman declined to comment. \",\n          \"MOSCOW (Reuters) - British foreign minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that London could not ignore Russia s meddling in elections around the world, its actions in Ukraine, or the persecution of gay people in Chechnya.

He also endorsed Senators John McCain of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, calling Ayotte a \\u201crising star.\\u201d \\u201cWe will have disagreements, but we will disagree as friends,\\u201d Trump said,  Trump earlier this week refused to endorse Ryan, telling The Washington Post he was \\u201cnot quite there yet\\u201d - nearly the same phrase Ryan had used about Trump before finally endorsing him. Trump said in the same interview that McCain had not done enough for veterans and criticized Ayotte for distancing herself from him during the campaign. Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican, had no plans to attend the Wisconsin event, a sign of lingering frictions between the pair, even though Trump\\u2019s running mate, Mike Pence, did endorse him. Ryan\\u2019s Republican primary challenger, businessman Paul Nehlen, did attend, according to a spokesman. Ryan is expected to win the challenge for his House seat in next week\\u2019s Republican primary, and he is viewed by many Republicans as a possible presidential candidate in the future. The tension between Ryan and Trump caused deep frustration among party leaders and lawmakers. Trump\\u2019s endorsement came as one of several steps to get his campaign back on track after days of controversy and falling poll numbers that have given Democrat Hillary Clinton the advantage in the race to the Nov. 8 election. In the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday, Clinton\\u2019s lead over Trump narrowed to less than 3 percentage points, down from nearly 8 points on Monday. Trump said on Friday he wanted a \\u201cbig tent\\u201d party with multiple viewpoints welcome. He said he was endorsing the Republican lawmakers due to their \\u201cshared mission to make America great again.\\u201d Trump also announced a new advisory team to help guide him on economic policy. The group relies heavily on hedge fund managers and investment bankers, a group Trump has railed against. There are no women on the team. Trump plans to release his economic policy framework in a speech in Detroit on Monday, an event that will offer him a chance to avoid theatrics and detail how he would handle economic issues if elected. Trump economic adviser Stephen Moore told Reuters that the candidate\\u2019s plan would focus on four areas: tax, deregulation, energy policy and trade. \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to be an all-encompassing look at how we reform the economy,\\u201d Moore said. At events in Des Moines, Iowa, and Green Bay, Trump showed discipline that is unusual at his often free-wheeling rallies, calling Clinton the \\u201cqueen of corruption\\u201d and defending himself against her charge that he is temperamentally unfit for the White House. \\u201cAll my life I\\u2019ve been told, \\u2018You have the greatest temperament,\\u2019\\u201d he said in Des Moines. He also said voters should consider supporting him because of Pence, who appeared with him at both events. \\u201cIf you don\\u2019t like me, that\\u2019s okay. Vote for Pence because it\\u2019s the same thing,\\u201d Trump said. Trump bashed the media as well, saying reporters over-hyped an incident earlier in the week and claimed he kicked a baby out of an event in Virginia. \\u201cI love babies,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSHORT-CIRCUITED\\u201d Clinton sought to take advantage of Trump\\u2019s dip in the polls at a conference of minority journalists in Washington, where she pledged an all-out fight for comprehensive immigration reform. And she did what she has rarely done during the presidential campaign: take questions from reporters. She addressed two of the largest issues that continue to dog her campaign: the controversy over her use of a private email server while she was U.S. secretary of state and continuing skepticism among voters about her trustworthiness. Clinton conceded that she had \\u201cshort-circuited\\u201d earlier in the week in interviews when she had asserted that FBI director James Comey had concluded that she had been truthful in her statements about use of the private server.  Clinton had repeatedly said she never sent emails containing classified material, a finding that Comey contradicted at the conclusion of the FBI\\u2019s probe in July, when he rebuked her for \\u201cextremely careless\\u201d handling of classified information while recommending that no criminal charges be filed. On Friday, Clinton maintained, \\u201cI never sent or received anything marked classified,\\u201d while acknowledging that some material she sent may retroactively have been considered classified by other government agencies. Republicans have repeatedly charged that Clinton endangered national security with her handling of classified material. The email controversy has fueled a perception among a majority of voters that Clinton is untrustworthy. \\u201cI take it seriously,\\u201d she said. Still, as she has often done during her career, Clinton attributed much of her low standing on this issue to attacks from Republicans. Trump\\u2019s campaign said his economic advisory panel included former steel executive Dan DiMicco; Howard Lorber, CEO of tobacco company Vector Group Ltd (VGR.N); and Trump campaign finance chairman and investment manager Steven Mnuchin.  Hedge fund managers John Paulson and Steve Feinberg, Moore, the Trump economic adviser, and David Malpass, who has served in previous Republican administrations, were also named. Trump\\u2019s moves came after many Republicans urged the candidate to correct course following a tumultuous week. The real estate mogul and former reality television star was  caught up for days in a public spat with the parents of a Muslim  American soldier killed in Iraq. The parents had criticized Trump at last week\\u2019s Democratic National Convention. Many Republicans, including Ryan, McCain and Ayotte, were critical of Trump\\u2019s insistent attacks on the pair. \",\n          \" Fantastic testimony on the disastrous results of illegal immigration on the black community: FLASHBACK: Obama wrote in 2006 that Illegal Immigration HURTS  Blue-Collar Americans,  and STRAINS Welfare pic.twitter.com/wpvnqFgIQ9  NumbersUSA (@NumbersUSA) March 20, 2016 \",\n          \"After the release of nude pictures, that might have been meant as a distraction from Trump s disastrous two weeks beginning with the Democratic National Convention, it s been revealed that Melania Trump may have been modeling without proper documentation. In other words, she *gasp* may have been an illegal immigrant. Now, it appears as there have been more very strange things happening with Melania s immigration status. She might have married another American just four years before becoming Mrs. Trump.The story was broken by Univision, proving that taking away reporter access can backfire on a candidate. They claim that an immigration attorney who worked for the Trump Organization said Melania obtained a green card  based on marriage  in 2001. That was four years before she married Trump.But, Michael Wildes, an immigration attorney who worked for the Trump Organization, told Univision s investigative unit that she obtained a green card four years earlier in 2001,  based on marriage. Melania and Donald Trump were not married until Jan. 22, 2005 at Bethesda-by-the Sea Episcopal Church in Palm Beach, Florida.Wildes asked the Trump campaign for more, and so far, crickets.When asked to explain the marriage discrepancy, Wildes said he would seek clarification, presumably from the Trump Organization. He later sent an email saying  I didn t hear back, sorry. Wildes is someone who should know. He was the immigration attorney for Trump s models and for the Miss Universe pageant when it was run by Trump. According to Univision, he s not a defector from Trump, in fact, he was authorized by the Trump campaign to speak on their behalf.Still, Wildes says there are some things he can t discuss because of privacy issues.The Clinton campaign, officially, anyway, is refusing to make anything of this story. One former federal prosecutor, who is a Hillary supporter said that it s all  moot and ridiculous. Here s the video:The Clinton supporter is essentially right, but it does point to complete hypocrisy from the Trump campaign. Trump doesn t care about immigration issues. He never has. Trump almost prefers to hire immigrants over Americans, and well, his marriage history proves that he prefers his wives come from elsewhere. I m sure Democrats would be happy to drop the issue if, in exchange, we received a little intellectual honesty from the Trump campaign. Instead, Trump will continue bashing immigrants, and even people born in America to immigrant parents, while going home at night to a woman who very well might be one of the  illegal immigrants  Trump and his supporters love to rant about.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

He also endorsed Senators John McCain of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, calling Ayotte a \\u201crising star.\\u201d \\u201cWe will have disagreements, but we will disagree as friends,\\u201d Trump said,  Trump earlier this week refused to endorse Ryan, telling The Washington Post he was \\u201cnot quite there yet\\u201d - nearly the same phrase Ryan had used about Trump before finally endorsing him. Trump said in the same interview that McCain had not done enough for veterans and criticized Ayotte for distancing herself from him during the campaign. Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican, had no plans to attend the Wisconsin event, a sign of lingering frictions between the pair, even though Trump\\u2019s running mate, Mike Pence, did endorse him. Ryan\\u2019s Republican primary challenger, businessman Paul Nehlen, did attend, according to a spokesman. Ryan is expected to win the challenge for his House seat in next week\\u2019s Republican primary, and he is viewed by many Republicans as a possible presidential candidate in the future. The tension between Ryan and Trump caused deep frustration among party leaders and lawmakers. Trump\\u2019s endorsement came as one of several steps to get his campaign back on track after days of controversy and falling poll numbers that have given Democrat Hillary Clinton the advantage in the race to the Nov. 8 election. In the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday, Clinton\\u2019s lead over Trump narrowed to less than 3 percentage points, down from nearly 8 points on Monday. Trump said on Friday he wanted a \\u201cbig tent\\u201d party with multiple viewpoints welcome. He said he was endorsing the Republican lawmakers due to their \\u201cshared mission to make America great again.\\u201d Trump also announced a new advisory team to help guide him on economic policy. The group relies heavily on hedge fund managers and investment bankers, a group Trump has railed against. There are no women on the team. Trump plans to release his economic policy framework in a speech in Detroit on Monday, an event that will offer him a chance to avoid theatrics and detail how he would handle economic issues if elected. Trump economic adviser Stephen Moore told Reuters that the candidate\\u2019s plan would focus on four areas: tax, deregulation, energy policy and trade. \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to be an all-encompassing look at how we reform the economy,\\u201d Moore said. At events in Des Moines, Iowa, and Green Bay, Trump showed discipline that is unusual at his often free-wheeling rallies, calling Clinton the \\u201cqueen of corruption\\u201d and defending himself against her charge that he is temperamentally unfit for the White House. \\u201cAll my life I\\u2019ve been told, \\u2018You have the greatest temperament,\\u2019\\u201d he said in Des Moines. He also said voters should consider supporting him because of Pence, who appeared with him at both events. \\u201cIf you don\\u2019t like me, that\\u2019s okay. Vote for Pence because it\\u2019s the same thing,\\u201d Trump said. Trump bashed the media as well, saying reporters over-hyped an incident earlier in the week and claimed he kicked a baby out of an event in Virginia. \\u201cI love babies,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSHORT-CIRCUITED\\u201d Clinton sought to take advantage of Trump\\u2019s dip in the polls at a conference of minority journalists in Washington, where she pledged an all-out fight for comprehensive immigration reform. And she did what she has rarely done during the presidential campaign: take questions from reporters. She addressed two of the largest issues that continue to dog her campaign: the controversy over her use of a private email server while she was U.S. secretary of state and continuing skepticism among voters about her trustworthiness. Clinton conceded that she had \\u201cshort-circuited\\u201d earlier in the week in interviews when she had asserted that FBI director James Comey had concluded that she had been truthful in her statements about use of the private server.  Clinton had repeatedly said she never sent emails containing classified material, a finding that Comey contradicted at the conclusion of the FBI\\u2019s probe in July, when he rebuked her for \\u201cextremely careless\\u201d handling of classified information while recommending that no criminal charges be filed. On Friday, Clinton maintained, \\u201cI never sent or received anything marked classified,\\u201d while acknowledging that some material she sent may retroactively have been considered classified by other government agencies. Republicans have repeatedly charged that Clinton endangered national security with her handling of classified material. The email controversy has fueled a perception among a majority of voters that Clinton is untrustworthy. \\u201cI take it seriously,\\u201d she said. Still, as she has often done during her career, Clinton attributed much of her low standing on this issue to attacks from Republicans. Trump\\u2019s campaign said his economic advisory panel included former steel executive Dan DiMicco; Howard Lorber, CEO of tobacco company Vector Group Ltd (VGR.N); and Trump campaign finance chairman and investment manager Steven Mnuchin.  Hedge fund managers John Paulson and Steve Feinberg, Moore, the Trump economic adviser, and David Malpass, who has served in previous Republican administrations, were also named. Trump\\u2019s moves came after many Republicans urged the candidate to correct course following a tumultuous week. The real estate mogul and former reality television star was  caught up for days in a public spat with the parents of a Muslim  American soldier killed in Iraq. The parents had criticized Trump at last week\\u2019s Democratic National Convention. Many Republicans, including Ryan, McCain and Ayotte, were critical of Trump\\u2019s insistent attacks on the pair. \",\n          \" Fantastic testimony on the disastrous results of illegal immigration on the black community: FLASHBACK: Obama wrote in 2006 that Illegal Immigration HURTS  Blue-Collar Americans,  and STRAINS Welfare pic.twitter.com/wpvnqFgIQ9  NumbersUSA (@NumbersUSA) March 20, 2016 \",\n          \"After the release of nude pictures, that might have been meant as a distraction from Trump s disastrous two weeks beginning with the Democratic National Convention, it s been revealed that Melania Trump may have been modeling without proper documentation. In other words, she *gasp* may have been an illegal immigrant. Now, it appears as there have been more very strange things happening with Melania s immigration status. She might have married another American just four years before becoming Mrs. Trump.The story was broken by Univision, proving that taking away reporter access can backfire on a candidate. They claim that an immigration attorney who worked for the Trump Organization said Melania obtained a green card  based on marriage  in 2001. That was four years before she married Trump.But, Michael Wildes, an immigration attorney who worked for the Trump Organization, told Univision s investigative unit that she obtained a green card four years earlier in 2001,  based on marriage. Melania and Donald Trump were not married until Jan. 22, 2005 at Bethesda-by-the Sea Episcopal Church in Palm Beach, Florida.Wildes asked the Trump campaign for more, and so far, crickets.When asked to explain the marriage discrepancy, Wildes said he would seek clarification, presumably from the Trump Organization. He later sent an email saying  I didn t hear back, sorry. Wildes is someone who should know. He was the immigration attorney for Trump s models and for the Miss Universe pageant when it was run by Trump. According to Univision, he s not a defector from Trump, in fact, he was authorized by the Trump campaign to speak on their behalf.Still, Wildes says there are some things he can t discuss because of privacy issues.The Clinton campaign, officially, anyway, is refusing to make anything of this story. One former federal prosecutor, who is a Hillary supporter said that it s all  moot and ridiculous. Here s the video:The Clinton supporter is essentially right, but it does point to complete hypocrisy from the Trump campaign. Trump doesn t care about immigration issues. He never has. Trump almost prefers to hire immigrants over Americans, and well, his marriage history proves that he prefers his wives come from elsewhere. I m sure Democrats would be happy to drop the issue if, in exchange, we received a little intellectual honesty from the Trump campaign. Instead, Trump will continue bashing immigrants, and even people born in America to immigrant parents, while going home at night to a woman who very well might be one of the  illegal immigrants  Trump and his supporters love to rant about.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a conservative Republican faction in the U.S. Congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a “fiscal conservative” on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. “The (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‘We’re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,’” Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. “Now, Democrats are saying that’s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don’t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people’s money,” he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party’s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. “It’s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,” Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. “This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we’re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,” Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform,” as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, “entitlement” programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan’s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. “We need to do DACA clean,” she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid. \n",
